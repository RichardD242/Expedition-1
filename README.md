# Expedition 1

**Expedition 1** is a personal rocket launch project built just for fun, experimentation, and learning. The goal is simple: design, build, and (safely!) launch a rocket — while exploring all the exciting engineering challenges that come with it.

This is a solo, hobbyist project — no guarantees, no stress, just skyward ambition.

##  Mission Statement

To ignite curiosity, test ideas, and push boundaries — even if it's just a few hundred feet at a time.

##  Project Scope

- **Design:** Conceptual and physical design of the rocket body and propulsion system.
- **Build:** Construct a real-world model (low-power or high-power, depending on phase).
- **Code:** Optional onboard microcontroller scripting (altitude tracking, telemetry, staging logic).
- **Test:** Ground-based system checks and small-scale tests.
- **Launch:** A safe, successful flight.
